## Definition

A [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) container is a linux container optimized for HPC workloads. <span id="question-how-was-singularity-started"></span> It was started in 2016 at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.

## History

<span id="question-where-does-the-term-singularity-originate"></span>"Singularity" was meant to indicate the final, holistic entrypoint for creating encapsulated environments. We'll see how that works out.

## Tutorials

 - [Using Singularity on an HPC Cluster](https://github.com/bdusell/singularity-tutorial) <span id='question-how-do-i-use-singularity-on-an-hpc-cluster'> This tutorial is for using Singularity on the CRC computing cluster at the University of Notre Dame, which uses the SGE job scheduling system. It serves as a general introduction to containers and may be applicable to other computing clusters as well. The tutorial walks you through the process of building a container and running a GPU-accelerated PyTorch program on a GPU node. It also has tips for managing Python packages efficiently.
 - [Harvard Using Singularity on Odyssey](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/documentation/software/singularity-on-odyssey/): a tutorial for using SBATCH or an interactive session with slurm to build containers.
